def skel_to_graph(Iskel):
    """
    Resolves a skeleton into its consitutent links and nodes.
    This function finds a starting point to walk along a skeleton, then begins
    the walk. Rules are in place to ensure the network is fully resolved. One
    of the key algorithms called by this function involves the identfication of
    branchpoints in a way that eliminates unnecessary ones to create a parsimonious
    network. Rules are baked in for how to walk along the skeleton in cases
    where multiple branchpoints are clustered or there are multiple possible
    links to walk along.

    Note that some minor adjustments to the skeleton may be made in order to
    reduce the complexity of the network. For example, in the case of a "+"
    with a missing center pixel in the skeleton, this function will add the
    pixel to the center to enable the use of a single branchpoint as opposed to
    four.

    The takeaway is that there is no guarantee that the input skeleton will
    be perfectly preserved when network-ifying. One possible workaround, if
    perfect preservation is required, is to resample the skeleton to double the
    resolution.

    Parameters
    ----------
    Iskel : np.ndarray
        Binary image of a skeleton.

    Returns
    -------
    links : dict
        Links of the network with four properties:

        1. 'id' - a list of unique ids for each link in the network

        2. 'idx' - a list containing the pixel indices within Iskel that defines the link. These are ordered.

        3. 'conn' - a list of 2-element lists containing the node ids that the link is connected to.

        4. 'n_networks' - the number of disconnected networks found in the skeleton

    nodes : dict
        Nodes of the network with four properties:

        1. 'id' - a list of unique ids for each node in the network

        2. 'idx' - the index within Iskel of the node location

        3. 'conn' - a list of lists containing the link ids connected to this node
