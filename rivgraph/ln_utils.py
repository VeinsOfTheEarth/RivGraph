def link_widths_and_lengths(links, Idt, pixlen=1):
    """
    Compute all link widths and lengths.

    Computes link widths and lengths for all links in the network. A
    distance transform approach is used where the width of a pixel is its
    distance to the nearest non-max pixel times two.

    There is a slight twist. When a skeleton is computed for a very wide
    channel with a narrow tributary, there is a very straight section of the
    skeleton as it leaves the wide channel to go into the tributary; this
    straight section (so-called "false" pixels) should not be used to compute
    average link width, as it's technically part of the wide channel. The twist
    here accounts for that by elminating the ends of the each link from
    computing widths and lengths, where the distance along each end is equal to
    the half-width of the endmost pixels. Adjusted link widths and lengths are
    also computed that account for this effect.

    The following new attributes are added to the links dictionary:

    - 'len' : the length of the full link

    - 'wid_pix' : the width of each pixel in the link

    - 'wid' : the average width of all pixels of the link

    - 'wid_adj' : the "adjusted" average width of all link pixels excluding
                  "false" pixels

    - 'wid_med' : median of 'adjusted' width values

    - 'len_adj' : the "adjusted" length of the link after excluding
                  "false" pixels

    - 'sinuosity' : simple sinuosity using euclidean distances in the array-
                    space. does not take projection or geoid into account.
                    is length of channel / euclidean distance

    Parameters
    ----------
    links : dict
        Network links and associated properties.
    Idt : np.array
        Distance transform of the original mask.
    pixlen : float or int, optional
        Length (or resolution) of the pixel. If provided, assumes that the
        pixel resolution is the same in the horizontal and vertical directions.
        The default is 1, which corresponds to computing widths and lengths
        in units of pixels.

    acute-most angle between these two links is returned.

    The direction of an individual link is poorly constrained. The number of
    pixels along the link to consider for computing its direction can result
    in vastly different directions depending on the link's morphology. The
    weight argument above allows a degree of control over how to weight the
    contribution of pixels to a link's direction vector.

    Also computes the ratio of link widths (max/min) at junctions, and

    (diverging).

    The following attributes are appended to the nodes dictionary:

    - **int_ang** : the interior angle between the two links in the

    - **width_ratio** : the ratio of the maximum/minimum link widths for the two links whose directions agree

        How to weight pixel contributions to a link's direction vector as we
        move away from the joining node. Choose from

        - **None** : all pixels are weighted equally

        - **lin** : the contribution of pixels decreases linearly as we move away from the joining node.

def remove_disconnected_bridge_links(links, nodes):
    """
    Remove disconnected bridge links.

    When simplifying a channel network, there are often tributaries joining
    the network further downstream. These tributaries may have loops, which
    prevents their automatic removal by simple pruning.

    This function helps prune these cases by removing bridge links that are
    not integral to the network. A bridge link is one whose removal results
    in an increase in the number of connected components in the network. Each
    bridge link is temporarily removed from the network. This leaves two
    end nodes which were connected by the bridge link. A bridge link is
    integral if a path can be found from the end nodes to inlets and
    outlets (if one end node is connected to an inlet(s), the other must
    be connected to an outlet(s)).

    After all non-integral bridge links are removed, the connected component
    network that contains the inlet and outlets is returned; all other
    subnetworks are removed.

    Parameters
    ----------
    links : dict
        Network links and associated properties.
    nodes : dict
        Network nodes and associated properties.

    Returns

def add_artificial_nodes(links, nodes, gd_obj):
    """
    Add artificial nodes.

    Some topologic metrics fail for graphs that contain parallel links, or
    links that share the same end nodes. This function alleviates that issue
    by inserting artificial nodes into all but one of the parallel links. The
    shortest link of the parallel set will not receive an artificial node.
    For simplicity of coding, when a node is added, the old link is deleted and
    two new links are put in its place.

    A new attribute is appended to the nodes dictionary called 'arts' that
    contains the node IDs of artifical nodes.

    If flow directions are needed, this function should be run after setting
    them. If flow directions have been set for links, the properties of the
    link that is broken into two are appended to the two parts. This may result
    in some properties that are no longer correct, e.g. slope.

    Additionally, the 'guess' attribute of the links where artificial nodes
    are added will be incorrect as it doesn't account for the artificial node,
    but references the original end nodes.

    Parameters
    ----------
    links : dict
        Network links and associated properties.
    nodes : dict
