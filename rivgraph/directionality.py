    direction of the main channel is used to set the unknown link.

    """
    Sets unknown link directions by determining which flow direction through
    the link minimizes the overall change in flow direction at the connecting
    nodes. For a set of links connected to a node, at least one of the links'
    directions must be known for this algorithm to be effective. Links are
    set from longest to shortest, as longer links generally have less
    uncertainty associated with their directions.

    A number of thresholds are provided as options to control the power of
    the algorithm. This function should generally be applied iteratively,
    beginning with the most restrictive thresholds and gradually relaxing
    them.

    Parameters
    ----------

        Network links and associated properties.
    nodes : dict

    imshape : tuple

    angthresh : float, optional
        Angle in radians to determine if an unknown link is parallel enough to
        its connected known links to set its direction. The default is 2.
    lenthresh : int, optional
        Length in pixels of the minimum link length required to use this
        algorithm to set its directionality. The default is 0.
    nknown_thresh : int, optional
        Number of known connected links required to use this algorithm to
        set the unknown link's directionality. The default is 1.
    alg : float, optional
        Algorithm ID to assign to the set link. The default is 6.
