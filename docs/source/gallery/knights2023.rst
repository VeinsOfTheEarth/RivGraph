`This publication <https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2022GL102201>`_
made use of RivGraph's flux modeling to estimate nitrate retention in Arctic
river deltas.

    # Maps of nitrate concentration for the (a) Yenisei, (b) Yukon, (c) Kolyma,
    # (d) Mackenzie, and (e) Lena deltas. Hollow arrows represent general flow
    # direction. Concentrations at each link are relative to the maximum load
    # entering each delta. Mean discharge, temperature, and inflow concentration
    # measured at the delta apices (solid red dots) by the Arctic Great Rivers
    # Observatory were used to parametrize the model. Hollow red dots represent
    # ungauged inlet nodes. The thickness of each link is linearly weighted by
    # discharge with the thickest and thinnest lines representing discharges of
    # 19,300 and 0.129 m3sâˆ’1, respectively. Values in red are simulated retention
    # rates in percent and metric tons per day, respectively. (f) Map of the
    # watersheds drained by the Kolyma (K), Lena (L), Mackenzie (M), Yenisei (Ye),
    # and Yukon (Yu).
