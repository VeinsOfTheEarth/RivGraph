made use of RivGraph's flux modeling to estimate nitrate retention in Arctic
river deltas.

# Maps of nitrate concentration for the (a) Yenisei, (b) Yukon, (c) Kolyma,
# (d) Mackenzie, and (e) Lena deltas. Hollow arrows represent general flow
# direction. Concentrations at each link are relative to the maximum load
# entering each delta. Mean discharge, temperature, and inflow concentration
# measured at the delta apices (solid red dots) by the Arctic Great Rivers
# Observatory were used to parametrize the model. Hollow red dots represent
# ungauged inlet nodes. The thickness of each link is linearly weighted by
# discharge with the thickest and thinnest lines representing discharges of
# 19,300 and 0.129 m3sâˆ’1, respectively. Values in red are simulated retention
# rates in percent and metric tons per day, respectively. (f) Map of the
# watersheds drained by the Kolyma (K), Lena (L), Mackenzie (M), Yenisei (Ye),
# and Yukon (Yu).
