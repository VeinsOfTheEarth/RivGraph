About
-----

RivGraph is a Python package that provides tools for converting a binary mask of a channel network into a directed, weighted graph (i.e. a set of connected links and nodes).

![Core functionality of RivGraph.\label{fig:corefunctions}](https://github.com/VeinsOfTheEarth/RivGraph/blob/master/examples/images/rivgraph_overview_white.PNG)

The figure above demonstrates the core components of RivGraph, but many other features are provided, including:

- Morphologic metrics (lengths, widths, branching angles, braiding indices)
- Algebraic representations of the channel network graph
- Topologic metrics (both topologic and dynamic such as alternative paths, flux sharing, entropies, mutual information, etc.)
- Tools for cleaning and preparing your binary channel network mask
- Island detection, metrics, and filtering
- Mesh generation for characterizing along-river characteristics
- (beta) Tools for centerline migration analysis

All of RivGraph's functionality maintains and respects georeferencing information. If you start with a georeferenced mask (e.g. a GeoTIFF), RivGraph exports your results in the CRS (coordinate reference system) of your mask for convenient mapping, analysis, and fusion with other datasets in a GIS.

You can see some description of RivGraph's functionality via this [AGU poster](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/329845073_Automatic_Extraction_of_Channel_Network_Topology_RivGraph), and the flow directionality logic and validation is described in our [ESurf Dynamics paper](https://www.earth-surf-dynam.net/8/87/2020/esurf-8-87-2020.html). Examples demonstrating the basic RivGraph features are available for a [delta channel network](https://github.com/VeinsOfTheEarth/RivGraph/blob/master/examples/delta_example.ipynb) and a [braided river](https://github.com/VeinsOfTheEarth/RivGraph/blob/master/examples/braided_river_example.ipynb).

Installing
-----

RivGraph is hosted at conda-forge. We recommend installing into a fresh conda environment to minimize the risk of dependency clashes. The easiest way to do this is to open Terminal (Mac/Unix) or Anaconda Prompt (Windows) and type:

<pre><code>conda create -n rivgraph_env rivgraph -c conda-forge
conda activate rivgraph_env
</code></pre>

You may then want to install Spyder or your preferred IDE. Conda should fetch all the required dependencies and handle versioning.

If you want to install RivGraph into an already-existing environment, you can run <pre><code>conda activate myenv
conda install rivgraph -c conda-forge</code></pre>

You may also [install RivGraph from this Github repo](https://VeinsOfTheEarth.github.io/RivGraph/install/index.html#installation-from-source).

Instructions for testing your installation are available [here](https://VeinsOfTheEarth.github.io/RivGraph/install/index.html#installation-from-source).

How to use?
-----

Please see the [documentation](https://VeinsOfTheEarth.github.io/RivGraph/) for more detailed instructions.

RivGraph requires that you provide a binary mask of your network. [This page](https://VeinsOfTheEarth.github.io/RivGraph/maskmaking/index.html) provides some help, hints, and tools for finding or creating your mask.

To see what RivGraph does and how to operate it, you can work through the [Colville Delta example](https://github.com/VeinsOfTheEarth/RivGraph/blob/master/examples/delta_example.ipynb) or the [Brahmaputra River example](https://github.com/VeinsOfTheEarth/RivGraph/blob/master/examples/braided_river_example.ipynb). Both examples include sample masks.

RivGraph contains two primary classes (`delta` and `river`) that provide convenient methods for creating a processing workflow for a channel network. As the examples demonstrate, you can instantiate a delta or river class, then apply associated methods for each. After looking at the examples, take a look at [classes.py](https://github.com/VeinsOfTheEarth/RivGraph/blob/master/rivgraph/classes.py) to understand what methods are available.

**Note**: there are many functions under the hood that may be useful to you. Check out the [im_utils script](https://github.com/VeinsOfTheEarth/RivGraph/blob/master/rivgraph/im_utils.py) (image utilities) in particular for functions to help whip your mask into shape!
